The "documentation" directory is a critical component of InteractiveGameCraftMedia repositories.

It serves as a knowledge hub where contributors can share project documentation, including setup guides, API references and contribution guidelines.

Clear and comprehensive documentation ensures that contributors, whether working on installations, web apps, multimedia experiences or game development have the necessary information to understand, contribute to and collaborate effectively on the projects housed within the repositories.
