The "source-code" directory within the InteractiveGameCraftMedia repository serves as a centralised repository for the codebase of various game development projects.

Contributors can share and collaborate on game source code, providing insights into game mechanics, algorithms and overall project architecture.

This directory is essential for game developers looking to contribute code, explore different game development paradims and collaborate on the technical aspects of creating interactive and entertaining games.
